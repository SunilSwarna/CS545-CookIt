To the eggs as you are beating them in a bowl, start to DRIZZLE some of the hot broth into the eggs. (IF YOU ADD THE BROTH FAST YOU WILL COOK THE EGGS).
When egg mixture is very warm I use about 2-3 cups of broth. SLOWLY add back into soup. STIRRING while you add it in.
Let cook, stirring off and on for about 5 minutes until thick. The soup will thicken as it cools. Salt and pepper to tate.I garnish mine with parsley.

Simply lay them in a single layer on your lined baking dish. I actually had two more slices than what you see here but I couldn’t resist and had to eat them fresh. I make no apologies.
You’ll need to bake them in the oven for around eight hours, flipping them every few hours.The end result is perfectly chewy, naturally sweet, tart and tangy nature candy!`    },

Core and slice apples into rings or slices. Slice about 1/8in. if you want thin apple "chips". Slice about 1/4in. for thicker chewier slices. This is definitely easier with a mandolin type slicer(I used the Pampered Chef simple slicer), or food processor, but a sharp knife and patience would work, too!
Place the apple slices, in a single layer on cooling racks that have been placed on baking trays*. (No need to drain or dry them, just shake off the excess liquid and put them right on the tray.) Pop in the oven and ignore for the next 7-8 hrs. (It is helpful to prop the oven door open a couple of inches while the apples are drying, to let moisture escape.)When apples have reached desired dryness, turn off the oven and leave for another 30-60 min. Remove, cool, and store in airtight container.`

Add raw egg to pan and cook for 3 minutes. (NOTE: Right when the egg hits the pan, the egg white portion of the egg should immediately start to turn white - if it doesn't, the pan is not hot enough).
The edges of the egg should look dry and lift easily with a spatula. Using a spatula large enough to scoop underneath the entire egg, carefully flip the egg and cook for 1 more minute. 
(NOTE: The bottom of the egg should have a very thin layer of nicely cooked skin that is easy to get underneath with the spatula - if the skin is thicker and darker than a very light cream color then the pan was too hot)`

Take your streaky bacon and cut it in half length-ways, so that you have two long strips. Repeat until you have prepared all your bacon.
Next, take your sausages and wrap each one in a piece of bacon, rolling tightly from one end to the other so that only a little of each end is exposed. At this stage you can secure the bacon with cocktail sticks if you wish but the bacon should stay put if you roll the ‘seam’ under the bottom of the sausage.
Arrange your sausages on the baking tray and bake for fifteen minutes, or until cooked right through and slightly caramelised.
Serve up beside a roast dinner as a traditional accompaniment or as a nibble on Christmas day with a dip of onion chutney or sweet chilli sauce`    },
